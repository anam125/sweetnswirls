Sweet n Swirl – Android Food Ordering Application
📌 Project Description

Sweet n Swirl is a native Android food ordering application developed using Java and XML in Android Studio. The application is designed for a dessert shop where users can create an account, log in, browse dessert items, view item details, add items to a cart, place orders, and receive order confirmation.

The application uses SQLite database for data persistence. User accounts, cart items, and order details are stored locally using SQLite, ensuring that data remains saved even during screen rotation, app minimization, background/foreground transitions, and app restarts.

This project was developed as part of the Mobile Application Development course class activity.
